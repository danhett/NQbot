# NQbot
The tracery source for my @NQBarGuide twitter bot. 

Currently powered by http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/

Example output:
"We recommend Bike, a cosmopolitan gin bar in a warehouse on Turner St #NQ #northernquartermcr"
"We like Moustache + Shovel, an electronic whiskey bar in an old cinema on Oldham St #NQ #northernquartermcr"

Stuff to add:
- Image insertion (instagram, natch)
- Different grammars for tweets, so the format is mixed up more
- Responses, so people can ask it for a recommendation 
- Possibly fake map points, although this might be a bit TOO mean to people if they end up chasing around the NQ
